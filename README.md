# K-NEAREST NEIGHBOUR CLASSIFICATION FOR IRIS DATASET FROM SCIKIT LEARN

This is my first project on data science, learned this from a youtube video (url : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OO7Y5wQWnQs )

video description
Description: In this video, we'll implement K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm using scikit-learn. The K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a type of supervised machine learning algorithms. KNN is extremely easy to implement in its most basic form, and yet performs quite complex classification tasks. It is a lazy learning algorithm since it doesn't have a specialized training phase. Rather, it uses all of the data for training while classifying a new data point or instance. KNN is a non-parametric learning algorithm, which means that it doesn't assume anything about the underlying data. This is an extremely useful feature since most of the real world data doesn't really follow any theoretical assumption e.g. linear-separability, uniform distribution, etc. Blog reference - https://stackabuse.com/k-nearest-neig...

Special thanks to @itsron717 sir, thanks for helping out beginers like me.

iloc method gave me some issues. (ValueError: Unknown label type: 'continuous-multioutput). so some changes are made to it but not major changes.
